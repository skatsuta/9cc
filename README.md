# 9cc

Small C compiler designed in https://www.sigbus.info/compilerbook (Japanese).


## Development on macOS

This repository is being developed on macOS, while the above book explains how to write a compiler for Linux. To solve this mismatch, Docker is used to emulate compilation and testing for Linux on macOS.

This repository's `Makefile` is configured to support this situation, and if your OS is macOS and you have Docker for Mac installed, `make test` automatically runs tests inside a Linux container where GCC is installed.

```bash
$ sw_vers
ProductName:    Mac OS X
ProductVersion: 10.13.6
BuildVersion:   17G8030

$ make test
docker container run \
                --rm \
                --mount type=bind,source=/Users/skatsuta/src/github.com/skatsuta/9cc,target=/src,consistency=delegated \
                --workdir /src \
                gcc make test
cc -std=c11 -g -static   -c -o token.o token.c
cc -std=c11 -g -static   -c -o main.o main.c
cc -std=c11 -g -static   -c -o parse.o parse.c
cc -std=c11 -g -static   -c -o codegen.o codegen.c
cc -o 9cc token.o main.o parse.o codegen.o
./test.sh
...(snip)...
OK
```


## Currently supported syntax of C

Currently this compiler supports the following subset of C language syntax:

```
program     = (global-var | function)*
global-var  = basetype ident ("[" num "]")* ";"
function    = basetype ident "(" params? ")" "{" stmt* "}"
basetype    = ("char" | "int") "*"*
params      = param ("," param)*
param       = basetype ident
stmt        = "if" "(" expr ")" stmt ("else" stmt)?
            | "while" "(" expr ")" stmt
            | "for" "(" expr ";" expr ";" expr ")" stmt
            | "return" expr ";"
            | "{" stmt* "}"
            | declaration
            | expr ";"
declaration = basetype ident ("[" num "]")* ("=" assign)? ";"
expr        = assign
assign      = equality ("=" assign)?
equality    = relational ("==" relational | "!=" relational)*
relational  = add ("<" add | "<=" add | ">" add | ">=" add)*
add         = mul ("+" mul | "-" mul)*
mul         = unary ("*" unary | "/" unary)*
unary       = ("+" | "-" | "&" | "*" | "sizeof")? unary
            | postfix
postfix     = primary ("[" expr "]")*
primary     = "(" expr ")" | ident func-args? | num
func-args   = "(" (assign ("," assign)*)? ")"
```
